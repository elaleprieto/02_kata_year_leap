# 02_kata_year_leap
This is another classic, usually attempted as a follow-on from FizzBuzz and normally considered a slight step up in difficulty because of the slightly more complicated rules. In practice, most developers can hold an entire solution to FizzBuzz in their working memory, but the Leap Year algorithm is a greater cognitive load, so it's normally not possible in one go.

This starts to reveal the power of baby-steps TDD. An algorithm that by itself feels like a bit of a challenge can be split into small, easy steps. As a bonus, since you're test-driving, you'll have living documentation and a full suite of regression tests once you've finished!

Carefully choosing the next test is essential - if you find yourself doing too large a step at any point, ask yourself: have you picked the right test case? You might need to wind back more than one step before you find an easier route. Like with other katas, success on this kata doesn't just mean that "it works": you can do it again and again to refine your approach (see Defining "Done" below).
